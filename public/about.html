<h1>About Me</h1>

  coding, I am confident that I can make significant contributions to your team.</p>

<p>In my last role as an Associate Technical Lead - QA at Delivery Solutions, I have managed the Automation team,
  created a framework to perform load testing, and utilized Selenium, Appium, and Jmeter for API testing and load
  testing. Additionally, I have worked closely with the manual testing team to ensure that automation is seamlessly
  integrated into the testing process.</p>

  automation base framework using Selenium and Appium. Additionally, I have experience troubleshooting client issues
  using web and mobile automation.

<p>Moreover, I have demonstrated my ability to design and develop automation frameworks using Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, and
  RestAssured libraries/frameworks. I have also completed numerous projects, such as automated over 4K test scenarios
  using Postman/Newman and creating a Java RestAssured API automation framework from scratch.</p>

<p>I possess excellent interpersonal skills, including strong verbal and written communication skills, teamwork,
  adaptability, and creative problem-solving. Additionally, I have a sincere desire to learn about cutting-edge
  technologies and stay updated with industry trends.</p>
